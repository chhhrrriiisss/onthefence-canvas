# On The Fence

It's a nifty new web tool, designed to make your election vote count. On The Fence is an attempt to empower voters - young, inexperienced or unsure into making a more educated decision at the New Zealand Elections.

The original app from the 2011 general election can be viewed on the [website](http://onthefence.co.nz). This was created as part of a university project. The 2014 version will be an updated html5 app, with more bells and whistles and mobile optimization in mind.

This repo is a test case for using html5 canvas as a medium for the app using createJS.
